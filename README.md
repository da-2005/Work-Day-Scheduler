## Description
I was tasked with creating a work scheduler displaying typical work hours and having them be color-coded with red representing future hours, green representing the present hour, and gray representing past hours. On top of that, there's a text area that allows a user to input an item that's to be done for that hour. And that item is saved onto the local storage so if the page is refreshed, the to-do item remains until the user manually removes it.
